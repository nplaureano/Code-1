	<h1>Filmography</h1>

	<h2>Little Odessa (1994)</h2>

	<p>After graduating from film school at USC, Gray went on to make his first feature, the crime drama <em>Little Odessa</em>. Though a box office failure, the film garnered critical acclaim and earned Gray the Silver Lion, the Venice Film Festival’s prize for directing.  </p>

	<p>The film follows a hit-man who must return to his hometown and reckon with the damage his choices have done to his family. </p>

	<p><em>Little</em> Odessa established several hallmarks of Gray’s work: Gray would return to the film’s Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, setting in <em>The Yards</em> and <em>Two Lovers</em>; the film’s focus on crime would eventually carry over to Gray’s next two films, <em>The Yards</em> and <em>We Own The Night</em>; and, most important, <em>Little Odessa</em> eschews hip, ironic modes of storytelling in favor of a more classical, melodramatic register.  </p>

	<h2>The Yards (2000)</h2>

	<p>Gray’s second consecutive crime film, <em>The Yards</em> explores corruption within the railway industry of New York’s outer boroughs.  </p>

	<p><em>The Yards</em> established Gray’s long-term collaboration with actor Joaquin Phoenix. It also marked the first of two collaborations with Mark Wahlberg. </p>
